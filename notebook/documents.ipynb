Among the micronutrient deficiencies, anaemia is most \\nserious public health problem among children and women. Low access to micronutrient rich food \\nis the main reason of micro-nutrient deficiency. India is passing through the phase of economic \\ntransition and while  the problem of under nutrition continues to be major problem, prevalence of \\nnon-communicable diseases are becoming a very significant problem, especially in the rural & tribal \\nareas. Fresh vegetables are store house of micro-nutrients and their sufficient daily consumption \\ncould help in the  prevention of  micronutrient malnutrition and certain chronic diseases such as \\ncardio-vascular diseases and cataract. Vegetables are low cost nutritional supplements which can \\nameliorate this situation. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the consumption of vegetables in \\ndiversified form in the daily diets of the people.\\nFruits and vegetables start deteriorating after harvest and are available in abundance at low price \\nat a particular time of season. Due to lack of basic infrastructures and technical knowhow, post \\nharvest loss in fruits and vegetables is quite high. If these are appropriately processed, losses can be \\nsignificantly reduced, which are important for a country like India, where per capita availability of \\nprotective food is very low. Through preservation techniques, surplus fruits and vegetables can be \\nutilised properly and efficiently. Keeping this objective in view, this publication describing recipes \\nfor several preparations utilizing vegetables is being brought out. All these recipes are simple to \\nprepare and do not require any special appliances. Separate chapter on preserved products of \\nlocally available fruits and vegetables has been included to enable housewives to utilize fruits and \\nvegetables grown in their home garden or farm in an effective manner for achieving household \\nfood and nutritional security. This recipe book suits the requirements of the rural households and \\nadapts regional Indian delicacies.

The initiative is aligned with the National Food Security Mission of Government of India and caters the \\nneed for incorporation of vegetables and fruits and daily dietary habits of the common people. In order to capture the huge \\nknowledge resources lying scattered in various silos, it is deemed necessary to disseminate the information in a recipe book \\nform regarding nutrient rich vegetables and fruits that can be grown in the gardens at the household level, along with their \\nnutritional significance.\\nVigyan Prasar implements the initiative of providing food as well as nutrition security to the tribal families through \\nhome gardening through a project supported and catalysed by Science for Equity, Empowerment & Development (SEED) \\nDivision of the Department of Science & Technology, Government of India. It has undertaken the project “Development \\nof communication resources on applications of science & technologies for the home garden: Popularise locally adaptable \\npractices for real-life gains.” The recipe book has been prepared for the rural households in the tribal areas of State of \\nJharkhand. \\nThe initiative aims to present an easy to use information resource on locally adaptable tools and techniques for rural \\nhouseholds to enhance livelihood options. The objective of the initiative is to empower these women to diagnose and \\ndevelop need-based preventive and remediation strategies for use in a timely manner. These contents are also significant \\nfor tribal areas of Bihar, West Bengal and Odisha. As part of this initiative, Vigyan Prasar has developed a Crop Calendar, \\na Compendium of vegetables and fruits, and the Recipe book to be used principally as training material. These training \\nmaterials are to be utilised for providing training purpose to the agricultural extension workers, women workers in the \\ngrassroot level, Self Help Groups (SHGs), Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), and health care professionals.\\nAttaining food security is a matter of prime importance for India where more than one-third of its population is estimated \\nto be poor, and as many as one-half of its children have suffered from malnourishment over the last three decades. India \\nhas a history of hunger and food insecurity in the past. After seven decades of independence, India is still suffering from \\nthe problem of food insecurity that has caused the death of people due to starvation. About 15.2% of the population is \\nundernourished in India, 15% of children under five years are the prevalence of wasting (underweight as per height) and \\n38.8% of children under five years is the prevalence of stunting.\\nFood energy intake at the household level is now given prominence in assessing food security. It has become common \\npractice to estimate the number of food-insecure households by comparing their calorie intake with required norms. \\nAttaining food security is a matter of prime importance for India where more than one-third of its population is estimated \\nto be poor, and as many as one-half of its children have suffered from malnourishment over the last three decades.

       " Document(page_content='Basics of Nutrition\\nNutrition is a basic human need and prerequisite to a healthy life. A balanced diet is essential from the very early stages of life for \\nproper growth, development and to remain active. Vegetables are the most important component of a balanced diet. They are referred \\nto as protective foods because green leafy vegetables, other vegetables and fresh seasonal fruits are the treasure of several minerals and \\nvitamins and therefore provide protection from many diseases. They contain abundant amounts of iron, calcium, vitamin-C, folic acid, \\ncarotenoids and phytochemicals. Some vegetables like green leafy vegetables, radish, bottle gourd, cucumber, all type of gourds etc. \\nprovide low calories, whereas some others such as potato, sweet potato, tapioca and yam are rich in starch and therefore, provide energy \\nin good amount. Hence, the vegetables can be used to increase or decrease calories in the diet.\\nWhat functions do these nutrients and special factors in vegetables perform in our body?\\nIron \\nIron is an essential element necessary for the formation of haemoglobin, the red pigment present in the red blood cells. Haemoglobin \\nplays an important role in the transport of oxygen to the tissues. Reduction in haemoglobin in the blood leads to anaemia, a condition \\nwith symptoms like paleness, fatigue and increased susceptibility to infections. In green leafy vegetables, Iron is available in good \\nquantities. But the absorption of iron is limited. To improve iron absorption, foods rich in Vitamin C must be consumed daily.  \\nVitamin A\\nThis is a fat-soluble vitamin. It is necessary for clear vision in dim light, and for maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues. In vitamin \\nA deficiency, the white part of the eye (conjunctiva) loses its lustre and becomes dry. In severe vitamin A deficiency, the black part of \\nthe eye (cornea) gets necrosed, leading to irreversible blindness in young children. Vitamin A also has a role in maintaining resistance of \\nthe body to common infections. Carotenoids are plentiful in fruits and vegetables that are green or deep yellow/orange in colour, such \\nas green leafy vegetables, carrots, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, papaya, and mango.\\nVitamin C\\nVitamin C is an essential nutrient required for healthy bones and teeth. It also promotes iron absorption. Vitamin C deficiency is \\ncharacterised by weakness, bleeding gums and defective bone growth. Vitamin C is abundantly available in fresh amla, citrus fruits, \\nguava, banana and certain vegetables such as tomatoes.\\nFolic acid\\nFolic acid is a haemopoietic vitamin essential for multiplication and maturation of red cells. Its deficiency leads to megaloblastic anaemia. \\nFolic acid intake during pregnancy protects the foetus from developing certain congenital defects. It also promotes the birth weight \\nof infants. Folic acid deficiency increases homocysteine levels in the blood, thereby increasing the risk of heart disease. Green leafy \\nvegetables, legumes, nuts and liver are good sources of folates.\\nNon-nutritional factors in vegetables and fruits\\nVegetables also provide certain non-nutritional factors of considerable health significance to the human body. Among these, dietary \\nfibre, antioxidants and other bio-active constituents require special mention. These non-nutritional factors are required for delaying the \\nageing process and preventing the processes which lead to diseases such as cataract and cardiovascular diseases.\\n', metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Recipes Book.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Recipes Book.pdf', 'page': 12, 'total_pages': 178, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20200213105254+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20200213105327+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Dietary fibre\\nDietary fibre delays the intestinal transit of the food consumed. Dietary fibre is important for proper bowel function and to reduce chronic \\nconstipation, diverticular diseases and haemorrhoids. The protective role of dietary fibre against various digestion related disorders has long \\nbeen recognized.\\nAntioxidants\\nIn the recent past, the roles of vegetables and fruits as sources of antioxidants have been receiving considerable attention. Antioxidants restrict \\nthe damage that reactive oxygen free radicals can cause to the cell and cellular components. They are of primary biological value in giving \\nprotection from certain diseases. Some of the diseases that have their origin in deleterious free radical reactions are atherosclerosis, inflammatory \\njoint diseases, asthma, and diabetes. Raw and fresh vegetables like green leafy vegetables, carrots, fresh fruits including citrus and tomato are \\nthe source of antioxidants (free radical scavengers). The nutrients namely vitamin C and carotenoids that are present in these vegetables are also \\npotent antioxidants.\\nHow much should we consume?\\nThe Expert Committee of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), considering the nutrient requirements, has recommended that every \\nindividual should consume at least 300 g of vegetables (green leafy vegetables: 50g; other vegetables: 200g; roots and tubers: 50g) daily. Besides, \\nfresh seasonal fruits (100g) should be consumed regularly. Since the requirement of iron and folic acid are higher for pregnant women, they \\nshould consume 100g of leafy vegetables daily.\\nWhich vegetables should be consumed?\\nWe should consume locally available seasonal fresh vegetables. They have more micronutrients and are tasty. However, no single fruit or \\nvegetable provides all the nutrients we need. It is important to include varieties of vegetables with different colours in the diet for vital health \\nsignificance. Inclusion of commonly consumed leafy greens, tomatoes and other vegetables, apart from yellow, orange, red, deep red, purple \\ncoloured citrus fruits enrich the diets significantly.\\nHow to prevent cooking losses?\\nVitamins are lost during washing of cut vegetables and cooking of foodstuffs. However, proper methods of cooking can substantially reduce \\nthese losses. Nutrient losses occur when the vegetables are washed after cutting into pieces for cooking. Consumption of properly washed raw \\nand fresh vegetables is always beneficial.\\nHow do we get these foods?\\nGreen leafy vegetables (GLVs), other vegetables and fruits are easily available. Most vegetables, particularly GLVs, are inexpensive. These foods \\ncan be grown in the backyard with very little effort and cost. Even in lean seasons like summer, they can be grown using household wastewater.\\nHow to accommodate more servings of vegetables in a day?\\nTo get the maximum nutritional benefits from fruits and vegetables, it is important to find ways to eat more servings of vegetables per day.\\nKeeping this in view, this vegetable based recipe book has been prepared to enable the housewives to include more servings of vegetables in \\ntheir diet in diversified ways. These recipes are attractive, palatable, affordable and yet nutritious. Ingredients which are widely available and \\nare within reach of rural households were selected to formulate nutritionally rich healthy recipes which are region and culture-specific. The book \\nprovides the amount of calories, protein, fat and minerals contents per serving of the recipe.\\n', metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Recipes Book.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Recipes Book.pdf', 'page': 13, 'total_pages': 178, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20200213105254+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20200213105327+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

They are referred \\nto as protective foods because green leafy vegetables, other vegetables and fresh seasonal fruits are the treasure of several minerals and \\nvitamins and therefore provide protection from many diseases. They contain abundant amounts of iron, calcium, vitamin-C, folic acid, \\ncarotenoids and phytochemicals. Some vegetables like green leafy vegetables, radish, bottle gourd, cucumber, all type of gourds etc. \\nprovide low calories, whereas some others such as potato, sweet potato, tapioca and yam are rich in starch and therefore, provide energy \\nin good amount. Hence, the vegetables can be used to increase or decrease calories in the diet.',\n",
       " 'in good amount. Hence, the vegetables can be used to increase or decrease calories in the diet.\\nWhat functions do these nutrients and special factors in vegetables perform in our body?\\nIron \\nIron is an essential element necessary for the formation of haemoglobin, the red pigment present in the red blood cells. Haemoglobin \\nplays an important role in the transport of oxygen to the tissues. Reduction in haemoglobin in the blood leads to anaemia, a condition \\nwith symptoms like paleness, fatigue and increased susceptibility to infections. In green leafy vegetables, Iron is available in good \\nquantities. But the absorption of iron is limited. To improve iron absorption, foods rich in Vitamin C must be consumed daily.  \\nVitamin A\\nThis is a fat-soluble vitamin. It is necessary for clear vision in dim light, and for maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues. In vitamin',\n",
       " 'Vitamin A\\nThis is a fat-soluble vitamin. It is necessary for clear vision in dim light, and for maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues. In vitamin \\nA deficiency, the white part of the eye (conjunctiva) loses its lustre and becomes dry. In severe vitamin A deficiency, the black part of \\nthe eye (cornea) gets necrosed, leading to irreversible blindness in young children. Vitamin A also has a role in maintaining resistance of \\nthe body to common infections. Carotenoids are plentiful in fruits and vegetables that are green or deep yellow/orange in colour, such \\nas green leafy vegetables, carrots, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, papaya, and mango.\\nVitamin C\\nVitamin C is an essential nutrient required for healthy bones and teeth. It also promotes iron absorption. Vitamin C deficiency is \\ncharacterised by weakness, bleeding gums and defective bone growth. Vitamin C is abundantly available in fresh amla, citrus fruits, \\nguava, banana and certain vegetables such as tomatoes.\\nFolic acid',\n",

Its deficiency leads to megaloblastic anaemia. \\nFolic acid intake during pregnancy protects the foetus from developing certain congenital defects. It also promotes the birth weight \\nof infants. Folic acid deficiency increases homocysteine levels in the blood, thereby increasing the risk of heart disease. Green leafy \\nvegetables, legumes, nuts and liver are good sources of folates.\\nNon-nutritional factors in vegetables and fruits\\nVegetables also provide certain non-nutritional factors of considerable health significance to the human body.

       " 'Dietary fibre\\nDietary fibre delays the intestinal transit of the food consumed. Dietary fibre is important for proper bowel function and to reduce chronic \\nconstipation, diverticular diseases and haemorrhoids. The protective role of dietary fibre against various digestion related disorders has long \\nbeen recognized.\\nAntioxidants\\nIn the recent past, the roles of vegetables and fruits as sources of antioxidants have been receiving considerable attention. Antioxidants restrict \\nthe damage that reactive oxygen free radicals can cause to the cell and cellular components. They are of primary biological value in giving \\nprotection from certain diseases.

Raw and fresh vegetables like green leafy vegetables, carrots, fresh fruits including citrus and tomato are \\nthe source of antioxidants (free radical scavengers). The nutrients namely vitamin C and carotenoids that are present in these vegetables are also \\npotent antioxidants.\\nHow much should we consume?\\nThe Expert Committee of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), considering the nutrient requirements, has recommended that every \\nindividual should consume at least 300 g of vegetables (green leafy vegetables: 50g; other vegetables: 200g; roots and tubers: 50g) daily. Besides, \\nfresh seasonal fruits (100g) should be consumed regularly. Since the requirement of iron and folic acid are higher for pregnant women, they \\nshould consume 100g of leafy vegetables daily.\\nWhich vegetables should be consumed?\\nWe should consume locally available seasonal fresh vegetables.

       " 'Which vegetables should be consumed?\\nWe should consume locally available seasonal fresh vegetables. They have more micronutrients and are tasty. However, no single fruit or \\nvegetable provides all the nutrients we need. It is important to include varieties of vegetables with different colours in the diet for vital health \\nsignificance. Inclusion of commonly consumed leafy greens, tomatoes and other vegetables, apart from yellow, orange, red, deep red, purple \\ncoloured citrus fruits enrich the diets significantly.\\nHow to prevent cooking losses?\\nVitamins are lost during washing of cut vegetables and cooking of foodstuffs. However, proper methods of cooking can substantially reduce \\nthese losses. Nutrient losses occur when the vegetables are washed after cutting into pieces for cooking. Consumption of properly washed raw \\nand fresh vegetables is always beneficial.\\nHow do we get these foods?',\n",
